The decision tree begins with the question, Has there been a breach of a
computer system or does the entity reasonably believe that a breach has
occurred, being raised. If the reply is a No, no notification is required. If
the reply is a Yes, the question, Did the computer system contain
personal information, is raised. If the reply is a Yes, a check is done if the
personal information was encrypted, if the reply is a Yes, no notification is
required, but if personal information had not been encrypted, notification
is likely required, and the question, Does the breach notification law allow
substitute notification in some situations, is raised. If yes, a check is done
if the substitute notification requirements have been met. If the reply is a
No, affected individuals must receive written notice of security breach,
and on a Yes, an alternate notice is provided according to the law.
